## Summary

Scripts to configure various elements of AWS.  I like the powershell cmdlet naming scheme, which I've followed for these scripts, which should hopefully be fairly self-explanatory.
 
## Background

We are using the Evident.io security platform, which has several signatures related to default AWS configurations, many of which are insecure out of the box.  Being able to quickly close default security holes in an automated fashion is the end goal for these scripts.
 
### Requirements

AWS-CLI with configured profile
